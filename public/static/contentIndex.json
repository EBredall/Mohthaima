As we have walked the streets in our search, we have run into some rather unique individuals. First, a warforged calling himself Thaddius McNabb. He states himself to be in search of a ‘child’ warforged named Amir Jean-Baptiste. He seems unfortunately disabled, lacking any clock or ability to tell time whatsoever. Lady Piff and I had attempted to have him repaired in a mechanic’s shop, but alas, the stubborn fool attempted to not have these repairs. It took powerful urging to convince him.\nTo speak further regarding these new companions, we met them simultaneous to McNabb, though they travelled here separate from the warforged. An autognome known as Frankie Victorious and a human called Serophin, they claim to be healers of some sort. The two offered to assist in our investigation, and have been hired by Lady Piff. Thus far, they seem competent enough. Unfortunately McNabb’s investigation seems to coincide with our own, as he had a coin with magical traces that were similar to what we have found thus far, so he may somehow be useful later on.            .\nWhile we were on our way to the mechanic’s shop, we found a commotion in the streets. A few commoners running from something. From one of them, it was stated a murder was happening, so the seven of us went to investigate, and possibly intervene. The scene we found instead of a murder was an execution, already in progress, with the headless corpses of a man and woman on stage, not yet old enough to begin gathering flies. Still there restrained and yet to be killed was their child, a boy no older than 12. Lady Piff recognized the executioner by sight, while I only realized by name. Hema of house Evra stood, about to behead the child, until Lady Piff called out and begun a conversation with him.\nShe began to question him on why this child’s life had been demanded by the law, distraught as most would be upon seeing such a scene. The child’s parents had committed the crime of treason, and the king ordered them- and their likely indoctrinated child- unto death. Lady Piff, confident and… Principled as she is stepped onstage, stating she cannot allow the child be killed. Lord Evra commanded her step down, and as she refused, I advised she listen to him.\nTo state my reasoning, I must begin with making one thing clear; I am no supporter of the killing of children. If the child were to die, it would be a tragedy of course. However, I am one of caution and occasional pragmaticism to serve the well-being of the house I serve. To go against one acting upon the commands of the king is a risk to the prospects of rebuilding house Oros, and one I think worth more than only a single life. Before I had left and given my final advice to Lady Oros, Lord Evra had commanded the cloaked woman on the platform next to him- Taava- to carry out the order as he handled this. Unlike Evra, Taava seemed all too eager at the ‘opportunity’.\nWhile I cannot speak as to what happened there after I had left ahead to the mechanic’s, I can speak to the results after. By a miracle or blessing, somehow Lady Piff had convinced him to put off this execution so she could get an audience with the king. Of course, all miracles must come with tragedy, and our cost from this is the warforged by his horrid judgement was attracted to and began courtship with Taava. An issue we will have to sort out in the future.\nWe ended the day going separate ways, the new companions seeking a lawyer, the warforged going to his mistress, Lady Piff finding a place for the night, and later joining me in my trip to a local library to research. The books contained sufficient knowledge on the related laws to this case, but was quite lacking when it comes to my personal research. The pair that went to find a lawyer did return with news of one, though from the sound of it, his ‘skill’ is questionable at best. A record of minor crimes, with only one major case of domestic abuse. He had given them perfect recorded numbers of his wins, but had no data on his losses. We will have to question him tomorrow to assess his aptitude when we go to officially meet our client.\nSigned into veracity by Yzex’Kyllis."},"IC-Notes/Yzex'Kyllis's-Records/Session-2-TBD":{"slug":"IC-Notes/Yzex'Kyllis's-Records/Session-2-TBD","filePath":"IC Notes/Yzex'Kyllis's Records/Session 2-TBD.md","title":"Session 2-TBD","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"On the Thirteenth day of Seuda in the year Five Hundred Twenty-One,\nSigned into veracity by Yzex’Kyllis."},"Locations/Cities-and-Towns/Merkaza":{"slug":"Locations/Cities-and-Towns/Merkaza","filePath":"Locations/Cities and Towns/Merkaza.md","title":"Merkaza","links":["tags/City"],"tags":["City"],"content":"City\nThe Capitol"},"Locations/Cities-and-Towns/Tokarov":{"slug":"Locations/Cities-and-Towns/Tokarov","filePath":"Locations/Cities and Towns/Tokarov.md","title":"Tokarov","links":["tags/City"],"tags":["City"],"content":"City"},"Magical-Items/Death-Whistle":{"slug":"Magical-Items/Death-Whistle","filePath":"Magical Items/Death Whistle.md","title":"Death Whistle","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"If you blow the whistle in darkness or under the night sky, it allows you to cast the animate dead spell.

Shapiffany ‘Piff’ Oros searches for something unknown, followed by her two servants (Reginald and Dracuff) and Yzex’kyllis. Serophin and Frankie Victorius look for coin and bodies. Thaddius McNabb hunts for a man named Amir Jean-Baptiste… the party then meets on the street, by fate or happenstance…\nAmir is a missing child warforged, Piff finds out as she questions Thaddius. Yzex’kyllis gets a coin with manacles on it from him, and finds it is connected to Piff’s investigations. Serophin and Frankie are hired by the noble house to assist in the investigation, and Thaddius offers to do so for free, searching for Amir. Yzex’kyllis implements the whole party in a scheme to bring Thaddius to a mechanics to be repaired.\nAs we approach the shop, the party begins to see people running away from something, as Thaddius grabs one of the children doing so. The child is obviously terrified, and after Thaddius is forced to drop him, he tells us there’s a murder happening.\nAs we follow the opposite direction as the running, we find an in progress execution, with the only unexecuted yet on the block is a child of approximately 8 years in age, and the executioner and a cloaked woman on stage. The executioner and Piff recognize each other- the man being Hema Evra, a noble in direct line of the throne-, and Piff calls out and begins to question him. The child’s family had committed treason, with the king ordering the execution of the family. Hema is far from enjoying this, with scars in his palms where his nails seem to have pierced skin. Piff steps onto the platform, stating she cannot allow this to happen. Lord Evra commands her to step down, which she does not, prompting Kyllis to step in.\n“Lady Piff… I really, sincerely advise you listen.”\n“I advise you know your role.”\nHema commands Taava Min, the woman on stage, to carry the order out to completion. She seems extremely gleeful at the prospect, as Hema blocks Piff’s path to the convicted. The crowd seems slightly more galvanized, but there’s no time to speak to fully incite them, as Taava approaches the child with her sadistic smile.\nA battle begins, as Yzex’kyllis leaves parting words to Piff, shakily as his fear for his own future outweighs his fear of falling slightly more out of favor after her last words:\n“… I leave you with a final plea. Think of the future. How many more people you would be able to help if you aren’t imprisoned. I will see you at the mechanic’s shop…”\nAs he slowly walks away, the combat continues. A man steps between Hema and Piff “Friends, there is no need to fight! I would hate to see two of our nations finest battle when we can instead have a talk about this, and suspend this execution a bit longer than we already have!”\nAs a round passes, Hema teleports next to Piff, enacting a stunning strike before holding his hand out for Taava to stop. She seems annoyed, before slicing the ground in front of the child, and combat ends. Hema states he can hold the child until the end of the day until the order must be carried out. They make a deal to have the child spared, but in the future none of those there can interfere with Hema’s execution orders in the future. The fat man who stepped between introduces himself as Pinuk Zlila offering cake to the party. The party leaves to meet Yzex’Kyllis at the mechanic’s shop.\nMinor Details\n\nThaddius attempted to flirt with the woman on the stage, and is apparently… endowed.

Positives save our souls. Yzex’kyllis heads to the library. After securing rooms to rest for the night with Piff, Frankie and Serophin search for a lawyer. The scholar house they find has a lawyer named Talyanna Bula, but the man they meet, Kokava, said he’s a rather bad and incompetent lawyer who mainly works in petty squabbles. They follow him down the hall to Talyanna, and begin to talk to him about his case history. He was bewildered upon being told it was an execution order… Against the king. He’s a very wanted man for my services specifically!, according to himself. Looking at his records, almost all the cases seem to be defending others in the scholar house. After discussing and bartering, Talyanna will get 2 GP if he wins or 4 SP if he loses.\nAs the pair heads back to the inn, we cut to Thaddius trying to find his date, heading to the district with taverns. Thaddius approaches with a whistle, as she waves salaciously. Double disgusting. Somehow, she’s into the whistle, but simultaneously confused and grossed out. There was a debate about whether or not to write down that Thaddius has sterile semen. Thaddius has terrible drink preferences and tries to hide it by taking whatever she’s having. She likes mead. She also has terrible drink preferences as posset is objectively better. I personally like sweet ciders. Talking about the execution, she mentions Gaava, who does the paperwork afterwards. They leave to do more disgusting stuff after Taava fails to chug a drink.\nChildren can be tried as adults and is purely up to the judiciary’s discretion. Guilt by association ranges from full equal punishment to around a quarter. The king’s name is Alberich, and seems similar to his father, Uria Yashari. He’s made many trade deals, notably with the people of the glass plateaus. Piff walks into the library. Hema’s wife was in the senate, as was one of Piff’s grandpas. The grandpa was removed when a whistleman died. Yzex’Kyllis reads a book on demonology. Its not exactly detailed.\nLong Rest\nAt the prison, we begin to discuss cutting down Talyanna’s pay. The abuse case involved accuser Akereta, and the client Matalela. The pay is docked to 15 silver. An executioner was already inside with our client, and unfortunately, its Taava.\nMeanwhile, Thaddius heads to try to find this Gaava. With the help of a random woman off the street, he is pointed to the bakery, where he decides to wait to see if Pinuk comes by, after hearing from the baker there that he sources some of his sweets from there.
