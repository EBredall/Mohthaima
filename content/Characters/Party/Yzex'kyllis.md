A lizardfolk sorcerer working under [[Shapiffany 'Piff' Oros|Lady Piff]] to help restore the Oros family's status. Wears fine clothing and a monocle, carrying himself in a confident and almost proud way. His main motivation seems to be his own future well-being, especially when it comes to money- However, no one knows particularly what he plans to use this wealth for. He sometimes makes comments about multiple gods, seeming to have rudimentary knowledge of multiple religions. While he seems to have some amount of morals- clearly not enjoying the fact the king ordered a child killed- he currently seems to be no hero, not having the immediate courage to intervene in something so large, and advising the others don't to ensure their own welfare, stating it would allow them to help others in the future. 

***Notes:***
- Has grown horns on one occasion in the mechanic's shop
- Frills seem to have eye-like patterns
